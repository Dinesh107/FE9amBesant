User Input

Type Conversion = it will change the datatype of a value to another 
(String, numbers, booleans)

int a = 12;

byte 
short
int 
long

float
double

char

boolean

non Primitive --> we can able to multiple value in a single variable 

a = 2,"word",'a',12.45f, true;

Array, String, DS concepts(tree,stack, list, etc), COllections

Const ---> varaible that can't be changed


Javascript Math function 


Tasks

Conditional Statements in Javascript

a basic of form of decision making, if a condition is true, then we do something, if not then we dont't do it!

types of CS 

if, if else, nested if else Statements or if else if  

if

if() {



}

if else 

if() {



} else {



}


if else if statement 

if() {



} else if() {



} else if() {


 
} else if() {


    
  }

else {


  
}


switches in JS ---->it is statement that examines a value for a match against many case clauses.

More efficient that many "else if " statements

AND and OR operator 

&& AND (Both conditions must be true)

|| OR (Either condition can be true)



! NOT --> Typically used to reverse a condition's of boolean value 

True ---> False

False --> True

Control statements or Looping Statement.

Initialization --> were we need to start

Condition --> were we stop, this will run based true or false, if  condition true loop will execute otherwise it will stop

Iteration --> increase or decrease the value.

i++ = i + 1 --> Increment operator (Post increment)

++i = 1 + i --> pre increment

i-- = i - 1 --> Decrement operator ((Post decrement))

--i --> pre decrement

types of loops

while --> entry control loop

, do while loop --> exit control loop

let i = 1;

do {

 console.log(i);

 i = i + 1;

}while(i<=10);


for loop 

Break and Continue statements

Break --> It will terminate the loop

continue --> it will skip the particular Iteration


nested loop
